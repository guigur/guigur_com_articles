I love my labeling machine! The parts bin I've labeled looks so fancy. But not all my drawers are labeled yet. Why? It's because of this stupid rubber membrane keyboard. I could be so much faster if only I could connect a regular PC keyboard or even better connect the Dymo straight to the computer.
For sure, PC-enabled Dymo does exist, but it's quite pricey.
Furthermore, the tape system is not compatible with the consumer line of Dymo and prosumers and I've already bought a bunch of those.

## The teardown
I would lie if I told you it was the first time that I opened up this device.
The construction is very standard, with two half-shells held together by self-tapers.

## The Keyboard matrix

## Open collectors outputs to the rescue

## PS/2 Keyboard integration

## Custom PCB

## What's next?
